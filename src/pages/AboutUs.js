              About Me:Hello! I’m Alex, a full stack web developer with a
              passion for programming and enhancing my skills in the ever
              growing world of tech. I'm currently attending LEARN Academy's
              full stack web development program. I've trained in various coding
              languages and frameworks including JavaScript, React.js, Ruby,
              Ruby on Rails, and PostgreSQL. I've utilized test driven
              development to ensure I'm producing the most efficient code
              possible while also having optimal functionality. I am also well
              versed with both Jest and RSpec testing frameworks. Pair
              programming has also been instrumental in collaborative projects,
              providing backup for code structure, troubleshooting, and the
              overall highest quality teamwork in agile development. Skills:
              HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL,
              Jest, RSpec, teamwork, communication, collaboration My interest in
              computers and technology started at a young age when my father
              brought home our first family computer. The clacking of the
              keyboard keys, the shining display, everything fascinated me! My
              familiarity and competence grew through typing and computer skills
              classes in school as well as incorporating word processing and the
              internet into my educational tools. My technical prowess was
              further enhanced by my experience serving in the United States
              Navy. I learned the structure and functions of the various pieces
              of sonar equipment onboard submarines and how they all interacted
              and interfaced to provide the essential technologies to keep the
              ship safe. My tenure in the military also gave me valuable
              leadership and management experience. I've led multiple teams
              comprised of civilian and military personnel through systems
              upgrades, equipment removals and installations, and operational
              planning. My technical background coupled with working in a
              positive teamwork environment further solidified my career pursuit
              into the technology field. I enjoy solving complex problems while
              also collaborating with enthusiastic team members towards
              completing a common goal. Now equipped with the knowledge of
              computer languages and web development skills, I look forward to
              taking on any challenge!

              About Me:Hello There! I'm Chandler Gipson, a Full-stack Web
              Developer fueled by a lifelong passion for technology and a knack
              for hands-on work. My journey commenced with a deep-seated
              fascination for tech intricacies, particularly in how coding
              languages like Ruby and React interact. This fascination led me
              through various roles, including serving as an Army Veteran and
              operating cranes, instilling in me precision and attention to
              detail. My military background, specializing in reconnaissance and
              gathering critical information, has seamlessly translated into the
              coding realm. Rigging, air assault operations, and adaptable
              leadership learned in challenging environments have become my
              tools for problem-solving and critical thinking in the tech world.
              Through my experience I've mastered effective communication and
              operations management, skills now vital for collaborative coding
              sessions and project executions. As an Assistant Manager in
              framing, I honed budget management and team coordination, skills
              now seamlessly applied in agile development. Now a Full-stack Web
              Developer at LEARN Academy, I'm delving into the intricacies of
              React.js, HTML, CSS, and more. My journey is not just a narrative,
              it's a fusion of diverse skills converging in the realm of coding.
              From military precision to managerial finesse, my past roles are
              shaping a robust foundation for crafting innovative web solutions.

              About Me I'm Danny, a USMC veteran and realtor turned Full-Stack
              Software Developer, where my journey intertwines in the world of
              coding. Skilled in JavaScript, Ruby, React, and Ruby on Rails, I
              am not just coding; I am crafting pathways to diverse
              opportunities in tech, including a personal aspiration towards
              game development. Each project is a step towards a broader
              understanding of software development, with an eye on creating my
              own indie game or contributing to the next big title in the gaming
              industry. My path began in the United States Marine Corps as a
              METOC Analyst Forecaster where gained a sharp analytical mindset
              and attention to detail. Transitioning into real estate, I further
              developed my client service skills, understanding user needs — a
              critical aspect of both functional software and engaging game
              design. My fascination with technology and gaming sparked the
              shift to software development. At LEARN Academy, I find myself
              fascinated by the endless possibilities this field offers. From
              building web applications to exploring the potential of
              interactive digital environments, my goal is to blend technical
